### What I learned

This was a great exercise in trying to put myself on a website. From font choices to color palettes, it was a definite challenge to 'sum myself up' in a one page document.



### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap v5 Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - This is the first project that I've created using Bootstrap v5.0, so these docs were very helpful in finding the changes between v5.0 and v4.6.
- [Impressive Webs](https://www.impressivewebs.com/understanding-em-units-css/) - This whole write up definitely helped me understand the difference, and when to use ems and rems. Highly recommend!
